Thu

Priya —

Sending this ahead of standup so we are not negotiating numbers in the room.

Shipped
• Invoice CSV export is live. Two enterprise accounts that were blocked on billing files are unblocked.

Churn
• 4.2% for the period (finance, not the 3.8% that was in the earlier draft).

Open
• PAY-441 (webhook retry on 500) — still mine. Target: reproduce today, patch or a named blocker by Wednesday EOD.
• Support-lead hire: first interview Friday 11:00. Scorecard will be in the doc before then.
• Nordic Goods asked for a one-pager on the billing export before they expand seats. Draft Wednesday; I will not promise a date on the thread until it exists.

I will not speak to churn as “about four percent.” It is 4.2.

        title: "The three things that slip",

   Done when: a comment on the ticket names either the patch or the person who owns the remaining 500.
   If ignored: it is still “mine since last Wednesday” on Thursday, in public.

2. Support-lead scorecard
   Done when: a one-page scorecard exists before Friday 11:00, with must-haves vs nice-to-haves, so the interview is not vibes.
   If ignored: you walk into Friday empty and the hire slips a month.

3. Nordic Goods one-pager
   Done when: a single page they can forward internally — what the export is, what it is not, and the honest date.
   If ignored: sales already said “this week would be huge.” Silence reads as no.

Not on this list, still real
• Confirm dentist Thu 16:30.
• Book inspection before the 29th.
• Book Sam.

Those three are on the calendar page so they are not “personal, therefore optional.”`,

Hi —

Thanks for the note on the billing export. I can do a one-pager you can forward: what the CSV contains, which accounts it unblocked, and what “expanding seats” would actually use.

I will send a draft Wednesday. If that misses your internal thread, tell me the real deadline and I will say yes or no against it — I will not leave a floating “this week.”

If useful, I can join a 20-minute walkthrough after the page exists. I will not schedule that until you have something to look at.

Best`,
