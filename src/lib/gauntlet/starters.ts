- Priya: “can you send the Q3 recap before Thursday standup? include the churn number from finance, they said 4.2% not 3.8”
- Mom texted: dentist Thu 4:30, confirm or lose the slot
- Jira: PAY-441 still open, “retry webhook on 500”, assigned to me since last Wed
- Notion: “write hiring scorecard for support lead” — blank page, interview is Friday 11am
- Email from Nordic Goods: they want a one-pager on the new billing export before they expand seats. No deadline. Sales said “this week would be huge”
- I promised Sam a 20-min 1:1 and never booked it
- Personal: car inspection expires the 29th
- Half-written status I never sent:

“This week we shipped the invoice CSV. Two enterprise accounts unblocked. Churn… wait for finance. Hiring still in screening.”

Subject: Website / maybe brand / timeline??

hi! we found you through a friend’s wedding site (the one with the linen textures?). we run a small ceramics studio in portland, 4 people. our current site is squarespace from 2021 and it looks like a placeholder. we need:

- shop that doesn’t fight with instagram
- a lookbook / editorial page for the new glaze line (oct drop)
- maybe packaging inserts? not sure if that’s you

budget is “not nothing but not agency” — last designer quoted 28k and we froze. we can do photos. we cannot do copy. we launch the glaze line first week of october and we are already late. can you talk thursday or friday? mornings better, west coast.

also our domain is harborandco.co but instagram is @harbor.clay — people get confused.

— Lina

My notes: I charge 6–9k for a marketing site + 1.5k shop setup. I have a slot starting Sep 8. I don’t do packaging as a default. I can intro a print person. I should not overpromise October if copy isn’t ready.`,

Prof kept saying “pareto isn’t fairness”. Competitive market: many buyers/sellers, goods are the same, free entry? I missed the fourth one. Price is a signal. Surplus = willingness to pay minus price for buyers, price minus cost for sellers.

Externalities: when someone else pays. Factory smoke. Also vaccines = positive. Pigouvian tax = tax equal to external cost. He drew MSC above MC. Coase: if property rights + low transaction costs, people bargain. Then he said Coase fails when lots of people (air).

Public goods: nonrival + nonexcludable. Free rider. Lighthouse vs Netflix (Netflix is excludable). Common resources: fish, rival but not excludable → tragedy.

He said “exam will ask you to classify a good and pick a policy, not recite definitions.”

Practice he shouted at the end:
1. Why isn’t a city park a pure public good on Saturday?
2. If a tax is smaller than the external cost, what happens to quantity vs optimum?

I don’t have the textbook. Test is Thursday. I understand 60% and I’m bluffing the rest.`,

- Electric bill: $186, due the 2nd. Autopay failed last month (card expired). New card is in the drawer, not in the portal.
- Landlord email: “window in the back bedroom still leaking after last ‘fix’. photos please this week or I close the ticket.”
- School: permission slip for the science museum, Fri 8:15 bus, $12 cash or check to “PS 41”. Signed by a parent. Maya needs a packed lunch, no peanuts.
- Pharmacy: Dr. Chen refill for the blood pressure med — 2 pills left. They want us to call, portal is down.
- Saturday: Nico’s birthday party 2–4, we said yes, gift not bought. He’s into insects and drawing. Budget $25.
- I told my sister I’d send the flight options for Thanksgiving (we host). Nobody has booked. 3 adults 2 kids. I am the default brain and I am tired.
- Car: inspection light has been on 11 days.

Posted: “own the weekly operating rhythm, vendor onboarding, and the glue between clinical ops and the product team. 5+ years. Comfortable in spreadsheets and in rooms with doctors. Not a people-manager of a huge team — more player-coach.”

Me:
- 7 years ops at a 40-person dental group: scheduling, insurance follow-up, two clinic openings
- Built a simple Notion + Slack standup that cut no-show rate 18% → 11%
- Not a software person. I can live in Google Sheets. I led 3 front-desk hires.
- Left because the group sold and the new PE calendar was inhuman
- I want a company that still talks to patients
- Weakness they will smell: I have never worked “startup” and I don’t have SQL

JD also wants: “experience with HIPAA-ish judgment” (I handled charts, I was not the privacy officer) and “OKRs” (we didn’t call them that; we had monthly targets).

We told the angel update “beta Oct 1”. Engineering is me + a contractor. The contractor vanished for 9 days. Auth still breaks on Safari. Dev has been taking sales calls and saying yes to a pilot with a 40-clinic group. I found out from a calendar invite, not from him.

I am not quitting. I am not screaming. I have been rewriting this in my notes app:

“I feel like you’re selling a product we don’t have and I’m the one who looks like the blocker.”

That’s an attack. I need him to: (1) pause the 40-clinic pilot, (2) tell the angel the real date (mid-Nov if we cut scope), (3) stop adding calls without a 15-min sync.

He hates being embarrassed. He will say I’m not ambitious. We have to share a slack with the angel tomorrow at 4pm.

I want to walk in with a one-page reality check, not a speech.`,
